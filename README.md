This is a WordPress Gutenberg Plugin that allows you to convert PLN in your favorite currency, with a real time API from NBP (Narodowy Bank Polski)

I used Local Wordpress (https://localwp.com/) for my plugin development.

To import this plugin into your local environment:
1. In your terminal, navigate to your Wordpress site local files, and into `\public\wp-content\plugins` folder
2. Clone the repository
3. Navigate into the plugin folder (`currency-selector-wordpress-plugin`)
4. Run `npm install`
5. Run `npm run start`
6. Add a new post or edit an existing one
7. Now you will be able to add a new Gutenberg block with this plugin
